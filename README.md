# SharkyScript

School project where the intention is to make my own programming language and learn how a normal other programming language works under the hood.

The UI is made in **ReactJS** simple and straight to the point, where you would be able to write some code and perform a lexical, syntactic or semantic analysis to it.

This programming language is pretty much a clone of JavaScript but simpler, with a shortage in some keywords, types, statements and a little more.
